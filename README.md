# Interactive-Calculator
This is one of my first projects I've worked on when I started learning HTML and CSS, it allowed me to make good use of my CSS knowledge and further develop my HTML skills.
It is a very basic task but took me quite a while since I'm new at this but I'm glad I managed to pull through
